<h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>

<p>As a Junior Programmer at Bohemia Interactive, I work on developing and implementing network and gameplay features for Arma Reforger. I joined the company in February 2023, to complete my BS degree in Creative Media & Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. For my thesis, I created a networked feature for Arma Reforger, using C++. After I graduated with a 9 out of 10 points, I started to work there full time as a Junior Programmer.</p>
<p>I have also gained valuable experience as a Student Assistant at Saxion University and as a Game Developer Intern at Thales. I have participated in various projects, such as building a game prototype for Thales, a global leader in aerospace and defense, using Unity 3D and C#. My goal is to become a professional network programmer, who can design and implement robust and scalable multiplayer systems for games. I am passionate about creating immersive and engaging experiences for players, and I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies.</p>
